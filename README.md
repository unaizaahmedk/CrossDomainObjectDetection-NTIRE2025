# CrossDomainObjectDetection-NTIRE2025

This repository contains our implementation project inspired by the **NTIRE 2025 Cross Object Detection Challenge** (CVPR 2025).

Rather than replicating the exact methodology from the paper, we explored a practical approach to few-shot object detection using a 5-shot subset of the COCO 2017 dataset and a pre-trained **DETR (DEtection TRansformer)** model.

The goal was to understand and experiment with cross-domain object detection concepts presented in the challenge through our own simplified pipeline.
